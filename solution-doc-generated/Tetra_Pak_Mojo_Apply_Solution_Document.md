## 🔷 Section 3: Solution Components

### 🗂 3.1 Data Exchange & Architecture

#### 📌 Diagram
```
[Job Board] → [Mojo Apply Form] → [Joveo Processing] → [Client ATS]
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
[Job Details] → [Application Data] → [Data Validation] → [ATS Integration]
```

#### 💬 Data Flow Description
The process begins with jobs published from the client's career site. Users visit the Joveo-hosted job application page where they fill in the Mojo Apply form. The application data is processed, validated, and integrated with the client's ATS system.

### ⚙️ 3.2 Solution Flow

1. **Job Discovery**: Candidates discover jobs through the client's career site
2. **Application Initiation**: Candidates click "Apply" and are redirected to Mojo Apply form
3. **Form Completion**: Candidates fill out the application form with required information
4. **Data Processing**: Joveo processes and validates the application data
5. **ATS Integration**: Processed data is sent to the client's ATS system
6. **Confirmation**: Candidate receives confirmation of successful application
