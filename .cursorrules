# Data Model Generator - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This project generates solution documents from Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) for ATS integrations, specifically focusing on Mojo Apply implementations.

## File Structure
```

├── BRD-provided/           # Input BRD files from clients
├── BRD_Template/          # BRD templates for different integration types
├── solution_doc_template/ # Solution document templates (Word format)
├── solution-doc-generated/ # Generated solution documents (Markdown format)
├── ats_data/              # ATS data model integrations
└── venv/                  # Python virtual environment
```

## BRD to Solution Document Generation Process

### 1. Input Requirements
- BRD files must be in Excel (.xlsx) format
- Files should be placed in `BRD-provided/` directory
- BRD should follow the standard template structure with these sheets:
  - Customer Details
  - Features Request
  - Pull Questions from the ATS
  - Apply Form
  - Set Questions Manually
  - Source Tracking
  - Domain Access
  - Static Client Level Question
  - Job Filter Level Questions

### 2. Processing Steps
1. **Read BRD Data**: Use `process_brd.py` to extract data from Excel files
2. **Generate Solution Doc**: Use `generate_solution_doc.py` to create markdown solution document
3. **Output**: Solution document saved in `solution-doc-generated/` directory

### 3. Solution Document Structure
The generated solution document includes:
- Client information and context
- Integration scope and objectives
- Technical implementation details
- Features configuration
- Question setup (static and job-filter level)
- Testing strategy
- Deployment plan
- Risk assessment
- Support and maintenance

### 4. Python Environment Setup
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages (if needed)
pip install pandas openpyxl python-docx

# Run BRD processing
python process_brd.py

# Generate solution document
python generate_solution_doc.py
```

### 5. Key Features Supported
- **Mojo Apply**: Joveo's hosted application forms
- **Client Branded Forms**: Custom domain hosting
- **Domain Access**: Subdomain configuration
- **Visual Branding**: Custom styling and branding
- **Question Configuration**: Static and dynamic questions
- **Screening Questions**: Automated candidate screening
- **Multi-page Forms**: Form pagination support

### 6. Data Extraction Rules
- Customer details extracted from "Customer Details" sheet
- Features marked as "Yes" in "Features Request" sheet
- Form configuration from "Apply Form" sheet
- Static questions from "Static Client Level Question" sheet
- Dynamic questions from "Job Filter Level Questions" sheet
- Domain configuration from "Domain Access" sheet

### 7. Output Format
- Solution documents generated in Markdown (.md) format
- File naming convention: `{ClientName}_{IntegrationType}_Solution_Document.md`
- Documents include emojis and structured formatting for readability
- All sections are properly numbered and cross-referenced

### 8. Quality Assurance
- All extracted data is validated before document generation
- Empty or invalid entries are filtered out
- Document structure follows established templates
- Generated documents are ready for client review

### 9. Maintenance and Updates
- Templates can be updated in respective directories
- New integration types can be added by creating new BRD templates
- Solution document structure can be modified in `generate_solution_doc.py`
- Process can be automated for batch processing

### 10. Error Handling
- Missing sheets are handled gracefully
- Invalid data formats are logged and skipped
- Empty responses are filtered out
- Process continues even if some data is missing

## Usage Examples

### Generate Solution Document for New BRD
1. Place BRD file in `BRD-provided/` directory
2. Run: `python process_brd.py`
3. Run: `python generate_solution_doc.py`
4. Find generated document in `solution-doc-generated/`

### Update Existing Solution Document
1. Modify BRD file
2. Re-run processing scripts
3. New document will overwrite existing one

### Batch Processing
- Can be extended to process multiple BRD files
- Each BRD generates a separate solution document
- Maintains client-specific configurations

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9+
- pandas (Excel file processing)
- openpyxl (Excel file reading)
- python-docx (Word document processing)
- pathlib (File path handling)

## Notes
- Always use virtual environment for Python dependencies
- Keep BRD templates updated with latest requirements
- Test solution documents before client delivery
- Maintain version control for generated documents
